A [Google Form quiz](https://goo.gl/forms/AIbOsn4XYOCqLLli2) created by myself and the other exec members of the society was taken by participants.
The results were downloaded as tab seperated values (sorting.tsv).
This piece of code reads these values and uses them to determine each participants Hogwarts House.
Finally, these results were then writen to a file as comma seperated values (results.csv).
